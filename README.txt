Hi!

Thanks for downloading my Phoenix Industries Cargo Resupply System mod!

This mod is based on the real-life SpaceX Dragon CRS system. It utilizes
MechJeb and Kerbal Inventory System, but can be enjoyed without either
of them installed.

Some notes:

The capsule is an unmanned, robotic probe. It features integrated RCS ports,
integrated MonoPropellant engines and KIS storage.

The two engines are a KSP version of the actual Dragon - which has 18
hydrazine engines - 16 of which are used for attitude control, and 2 "extra"
which are used for deorbiting. I have changed the 2 "extra" engines to function
as monopropellant engines and they produce thrust UPWARDS like standard KSP
engines, for ease of use in the KSP game.

The Extended Trunk parts come in two versions - a KIS integrated "pressurized"
storage trunk and a hollow, non-KIS "unpressurized" trunk. The hollow trunk
functions like a service bay - you can attach surface-attachable parts inside
or outside to be used. If you are using KIS, it's recommended to use the
pressurized version, since otherwise you would need to EVA to remove and have
access to the parts attached to the hollow version.

Each part folder contains two .CFG files. One is for the standard 1.25m size,
and one is for the bigger, 2.5m size. The bigger sizes are noted. If you prefer
one or the other, simply delete the corresponding CFG file.

Any other questions, comments, or concerns - please post on the official forum
